    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
        I had four years of undergraduate study in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a>. Now I am a student at 
        <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/">Concordia University</a>, pursuing Master of Applied Computer Science.<br><br>
        I am interested in machine learning, data science, and software development. I am currently looking for internships and jobs in these fields. 
        I am a hard-working, responsible, and self-motivated person. I am always eager to learn new things and improve myself.
